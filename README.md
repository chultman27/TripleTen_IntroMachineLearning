# TripleTen_IntroMachineLearning

This project involves developing a classification model for the mobile carrier Megaline, which aims to recommend one of its newer plans — Smart or Ultra — to subscribers currently using legacy plans. The objective is to analyze subscriber behavior and determine the most suitable plan recommendation based on historical data.

The dataset contains behavioral information about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans, originally used in a prior statistical data analysis project. Since data preprocessing has already been completed, the task begins directly with model development.

The goal is to build a model with the highest possible accuracy. A minimum accuracy threshold of 0.75 must be achieved, and the model's performance should be evaluated using the test dataset.
